GAME INSPIRATION: 
    1) Playdead's Inside(graphics, smooth mechanics, 2.5D, ambience)
    2) Vector (movement, parkour)
    3) Shadow fight 2 (fight)

movement/game mechanics
    - 2.5D
    - smooth animations
    - parkour/climbing
    - smooth interaction with environment
    - walking and jogging blend based upon joystick(on left of screen) magnitude
    - sprinting mode activated by button(on right of screen)
    - jump and slide buttons also there on right
    - movement mechanics should be smooth and *REALISTIC* af, requires a lot of blendy animations and transitions
    - in fight mode, the buttons change to punch and kick and direction of move is chosen based upon joystick direction
    - smooth camera movement/zoom
    - ragdoll features:
        1) super amazing ragdoll
        2) ragdoll activated on death, tripping, and when about to fall while moving on incline(use deadly physics)
        3) smooth transitions between ragdoll state to getting up (different animations based upon player lying on which side) to idle
        4) self balancing ragdoll physics(deadly knowledge about joints required)

game features:
    - low poly setup
    - motion only x and y axis only, NPCs etc can move in z axis also
    - evening and night environment
    - Joystick and three buttons setup
