GAME INSPIRATION: 
    1) Playdead's Inside(graphics, smooth mechanics, 2.5D, ambience)
    2) Vector (movement, parkour)
    3) Shadow fight 2 (fight)
    4) GTA 5 (ragdoll)

movement/game mechanics
    - 2.5D
    - smooth animations
    - parkour/climbing
    - smooth interaction with environment
    - walking and jogging blend based upon joystick(on left of screen) magnitude
    - sprinting mode activated by button(on right of screen)
    - jump and slide buttons also there on right
    - movement mechanics should be smooth and *REALISTIC* af, requires a lot of blendy animations and transitions
    - in fight mode, the buttons change to punch and kick and direction of move is chosen based upon joystick direction
    - smooth camera movement/zoom
    - ragdoll features:
        1) super amazing ragdoll
        2) ragdoll activated on death, tripping, and when about to fall while moving on incline(use deadly physics)
        3) smooth transitions between ragdoll state to getting up (different animations based upon player lying on which side) to idle
        4) self balancing ragdoll physics(deadly knowledge about joints required)

All the animations required(some animations would be missing here, add them here as they come into your mind):
1) Basic:
    - Idle, Walk, Jog, Sprint, and their turns
2) Intermediate:
    - Vaulting, Sliding, Step up/down elevated ground, crouching, crouched jogging and walking
3) Advanced:
    - Jog Jump, Sprint Jump, Falling, Fall to roll, Fall to hard land, climbing and descending walls, slide to crouched running
4) Expert:
    - Stop at ledge, jumping to cling on ledges based upon what part of body reaches the ledge like vector, fall to roll to fall
5) Legendary:
    - All the animations which are triggered when curstate = 4 and something interrupts the animation, eg like when fall to roll and a wall comes in the way, or if sliding and obstacle comes in front (refer vector)


smooth movement features(*deprecated*):
    - blend tree which consists of walk(0.5, -0.5 for left) and jog(0.9, -0.9 for left). (*) is the parameter "Horizontal"
    - if horizontal joystick changes slowly towards same direction as where the player is looking, then blendtree activate.
    - if horizontal joystick changes to range (0.4,0.6) or (-0.4,-0.6) suddenly, then transition directly to "idle to walk" then to blendtree
    - if horizontal joystick changes to range (0.6,0.7) or (-0.6,-0.7) suddenly, then transition directly to "idle to jog(slow)" then to blendtree
    - if horizontal joystick changes to range (0.7,0.99 or (-0.7,-0.99) suddenly, then transition directly to "idle to jog" then to blendtree
    - if horizontal joystick changes to range (0,0.2) or (0,-0.2) towards opposite direction as where the player is looking, then transition to backward walk. If the magnitude increases, then transition from backward walk to 180deg turn to walk, then to blendtree.
    - if horizontal joystick changes to 0.5 or -0.5 suddenly in the opposite direction as where the player is looking, transition to 180deg turn to walk, then to blendtree.
    - if horizontal joystick changes to 0.9 or -0.9 suddenly in the opposite direction as where the player is looking, transition to 180deg turn to jog, then to blendtree.

game ideas:
    - Girl character, who is a tiny human (about 2-3cm tall (changeable later), reference to my own little one)
    - Photogrammetry assets of my own stuff, parkour based on home stuff, eg running on tables, vaulting on books etc
    - Either running from a big insect, or eventually meeting her love (me) or both

game features:
    - low poly setup
    - motion only x and y axis only, NPCs etc can move in z axis also
    - evening and night environment
    - Joystick and three buttons setup
    -
